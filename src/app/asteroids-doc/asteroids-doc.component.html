      <p>Asteroids are minor planets, especially of the inner Solar System. Larger asteroids have also been called
        planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not
        resemble a planet-like disc and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as a tail. As
        minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered they were typically found to have volatile-rich
        surfaces similar to comets. As a result, they were often distinguished from objects found in the main asteroid
        belt. In this article, the term "asteroid" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including
        those co-orbital with Jupiter.</p>

      <p>There exist millions of asteroids, many thought to be the shattered remnants of planetesimals, bodies within
        the young Sun's solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets. The vast majority of known
        asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, or are co-orbital
        with Jupiter (the Jupiter trojans). However, other orbital families exist with significant populations,
        including the near-Earth objects. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic spectra, with the
        majority falling into three main groups: C-type, M-type, and S-type. These were named after and are generally
        identified with carbon-rich, metallic, and silicate (stony) compositions, respectively. The sizes of asteroids
        varies greatly; the largest, Ceres, is almost 1,000 km (625 mi) across.</p>

      <p>Asteroids are differentiated from comets and meteoroids. In the case of comets, the difference is one of
        composition: while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock, comets are primarily composed of dust and
        ice. Furthermore, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of cometary ice. The
        difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of less than one
        meter, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter. Finally, meteoroids can be composed of
        either cometary or asteroidal materials.

        Only one asteroid, 4 Vesta, which has a relatively reflective surface, is normally visible to the naked eye,
        and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to
        Earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short time. As of October 2017, the Minor Planet Center had data
        on almost 745,000 objects in the inner and outer Solar System, of which almost 504,000 had enough information
        to be given numbered designations.

        The United Nations declared 30 June as International Asteroid Day to educate the public about asteroids. The
        date of International Asteroid Day commemorates the anniversary of the Tunguska asteroid impact over Siberia,
        Russian Federation, on 30 June 1908.

        In April 2018, the B612 Foundation reported "It's a 100 percent certain we'll be hit [by a devastating
        asteroid], but we're not 100 percent sure when.</p>
