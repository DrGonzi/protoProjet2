      <p>A constellation is a group of stars that forms an imaginary outline or meaningful pattern on the celestial
        sphere, typically representing an animal, mythological person or creature, a god, or an inanimate object.

        Origins for the earliest constellations likely go back to prehistory. People used them to relate stories of
        their beliefs, experiences, creation, or mythology. Different cultures and countries adopted their own sets of
        constellations outlines, some of which lasted into the early 20th century before today's constellations were
        internationally recognized. Adoption of constellations has changed significantly over time. Many have changed
        in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. Others were limited to single cultures or
        nations.</p>

      <p>The 48 traditional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Phenomena and Ptolemy's
        Almagest, though their origin probably predates these works by several centuries. Constellations in the far
        southern sky were added from the 15th century until the mid-18th century when European explorers began
        traveling to the Southern Hemisphere. Twelve ancient constellations belong to the zodiac (straddling the
        ecliptic, which the Sun, Moon, and planets all traverse). The origins of the zodiac remain historically
        uncertain; its astrological divisions became prominent c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean astronomy,
        probably dates back to prehistory.</p>

      <p>In 1928, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally accepted 88 modern constellations, with
        contiguous boundaries that together cover the entire celestial sphere. Any given point in a celestial
        coordinate system lies in one of the modern constellations. Some astronomical naming systems include the
        constellation where a given celestial object is found to convey its approximate location in the sky. The
        Flamsteed designation of a star, for example, consists of a number and the genitive form of the constellation
        name.

        Other star patterns or groups called asterisms are not constellations per se but are used by observers to
        navigate the night sky. Asterisms often refer to several stars within a constellation or may share stars with
        several constellations. Examples include the Pleiades and Hyades within the constellation Taurus and the False
        Cross split between the southern constellations Carina and Vela, or Venus' Mirror in the constellation of
        Orion.</p>
