      <p>An exoplanet (UK: /ˈɛk.soʊˌplæn.ɪt/, US: /ˌɛk.soʊˈplæn.ɪt/) or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the
        Sun's solar system. The first evidence of an exoplanet was noted as early as 1917, but was not recognized as
        such. However, the first scientific detection of an exoplanet was in 1988, although it was not confirmed to
        be an exoplanet until later in 2012. The first confirmed detection occurred in 1992. As of 1 October 2018,
        there are 3,851 confirmed planets in 2,871 systems, with 636 systems having more than one planet.</p>

      <p>There are many methods of detecting exoplanets. The High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) has
        discovered about a hundred exoplanets since 2004, while the Kepler space telescope has since 2009 has found
        more than two thousand. Kepler has also detected a few thousand candidate planets, of which up to
        40% may be false positives. In several cases, multiple planets have been observed around a star. About
        1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an "Earth-sized" planet in the habitable zone. Assuming there are
        200 billion stars in the Milky Way, one can hypothesize that there are 11 billion potentially habitable
        Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, rising to 40 billion if planets orbiting the numerous red dwarfs are
        included.</p>

      <p>The least massive planet known is Draugr (also known as PSR B1257+12 A or PSR B1257+12 b), which is about
        twice the mass of the Moon. The most massive planet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive is HR 2562 b,
        about 30 times the mass of Jupiter, although according to some definitions of a planet, it is too massive to be
        a planet and may be a brown dwarf instead. There are planets that are so near to their star that they take only
        a few hours to orbit and there are others so far away that they take thousands of years to orbit. Some are so
        far out that it is difficult to tell whether they are gravitationally bound to the star. Almost all of the
        planets detected so far are within the Milky Way. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that extragalactic planets,
        exoplanets further away in galaxies beyond the local Milky Way galaxy, may exist. The nearest exoplanet
        is Proxima Centauri b, located 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from Earth and orbiting Proxima Centauri, the
        closest star to the Sun.

        The discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. There is special
        interest in planets that orbit in a star's habitable zone, where it is possible for liquid water, a
        prerequisite for life on Earth, to exist on the surface. The study of planetary habitability also considers a
        wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.

        Besides exoplanets, there are also rogue planets, which do not orbit any star. These tend to be considered
        separately, especially if they are gas giants, in which case they are often counted as sub-brown dwarfs, like
        WISE 0855−0714. The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the billions (or more).</p>
