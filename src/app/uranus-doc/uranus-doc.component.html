      <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary 
        mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions 
        which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify 
        Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to 
        Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as 
        water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere 
        in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud 
        structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior 
        of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.</p>

      <p>Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has 
        a unique configuration among those of the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the 
        plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators. In 
        1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands 
        or storms associated with the other giant planets. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased 
        weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second 
        (900 km/h; 560 mph).</p>

      <p>Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure from Greek mythology, from the 
        Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky Ouranos.</p>
