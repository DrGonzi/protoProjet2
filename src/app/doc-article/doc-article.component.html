        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
            According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
            Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. 
            Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.
            Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.
            The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
            Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.</p>
            
            <p>Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. 
            About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans.
            The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. 
            The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. 
            Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.</p>
            
            <p>Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms.
            Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. 
            Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive.
            In the history of the Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events.
            Over 99% of all species[32] that ever lived on Earth are extinct.
            Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely;most species have not been described.
            Over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.
            Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has about 200 sovereign states.

          <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with 
            a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the 
            Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune,
            are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity.The Romans named it after their 
            god Jupiter.[18] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough 
            for its reflected light to cast shadows,and making it on average the third-brightest natural object 
            in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.</p>

            <p>is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises 
            only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but 
            like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, 
            the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator).
            The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence
            and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that
            is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. 
            Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has 79 known moons,
            including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of 
            these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.</p>
            
            <p>Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and
            Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by 
            the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route 
            to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016.
            Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean 
            of its moon Europa.

      <h3>Mars</h3>

              <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after 
                Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the 
                "Red Planet"because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish 
                appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
                Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the 
                impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>

                <p>The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is 
                the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and 
                second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest 
                canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of 
                the planet and may be a giant impact feature.Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, 
                which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, 
                a Mars trojan.</p>
                  
                <p> are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of Mars, as well as the 
                possibility of extant life. Future astrobiology missions are planned, including the Mars 2020 and 
                ExoMars rovers.Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric
                pressure, which is less than 1% of the Earth's,except at the lowest elevations for short periods.
                The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.The volume of water ice in the south 
                polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of 11 meters
                (36 ft).In November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia 
                region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in 
                Lake Superior.</p>
                  
                <p>Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude 
                reaches −2.94, which is surpassed only by Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Optical ground-based telescopes
                are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest
                because of Earth's atmosphere.
